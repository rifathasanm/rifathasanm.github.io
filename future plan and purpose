
The future is never just one choice. It's a thousand. And they never stop. I will choose my future every day of my life. And should I wake up one day to find that my regret the choice I made the day before, then make a new one. Don't worry about whether I might be wrong someday. Worry about whether I'm right now. Tomorrow can wait.
